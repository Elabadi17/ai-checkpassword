## Security Best Practices for Developers

- Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) or [Snyk](https://snyk.io) to scan the code for potential security issues.
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like passwords or API keys in the codebase.
